## The reason why I want to do this:
I was feed up with the ***todolist*** app in Apple Store.
1. Most of them cannot send email reminder
2. Most of them have functions I don't need
3. The free account has limitations comparing with Premium ones
4. ...more...

I also want to prove to other that there is **no limitation** for web, and I believe it can do more than most guys' expectation.

<!-- more -->

## What I will do:
1. Build mobile apps for iPhone and android phone
2. Build desktop apps for Windows, Linux and Mac OS
3. All these will be done in less than 10 days, just before June
